# Chux Org 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

I'm Chuck Sailer, a software developer since 1996. A lot has changed over the years especially my waistline. I created **chuxorg** on Github to organize pet projects and to share some of my development experience with anyone
who may care. I stood on the shoulders of those who fought the limits of technology before me and fought many technical challenges of my own. 

I work on many types of things using **Go**, **Python**, **Javascript***, ***Typescript***. Feel free to steal my code and I hope you
can learn something from what I share. Enjoy.
