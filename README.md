# Chuck Sailer's next 30 days 

I'm a Senior Software Developer/Engineer/Architect with 27 years experience. Every 30 days I select an area of study. I do this to keep sharp and aligned with modern programming philosophies and approaches.

This 30 day segment will focus on languages, frameworks, and math for computer science.

Monday:
- Golang: Study for 2 hours
- Resource: "The Go Programming Language" book by Alan A. A. Donovan and Brian W. Kernighan

Tuesday:
- Python: Study for 2 hours
- Resource: "Fluent Python" book by Luciano Ramalho

Wednesday:
- React: Study for 2 hours
- Resource: Official React documentation (https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)

Thursday:
- Next.js: Study for 2 hours
- Resource: Official Next.js documentation (https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started)

Friday:
- Typescript: Study for 2 hours
- Resource: "Programming TypeScript" book by Boris Cherny

Saturday:
- JavaScript: Study for 2 hours
- Resource: "JavaScript: The Good Parts" book by Douglas Crockford

Sunday:
- Discrete Math: Study for 1.5 hours
- Resource: "Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications" book by Kenneth H. Rosen

In addition to the weekly schedule, it's important to allocate time for practicing Data Structures and Algorithmic Problem Solving. You can dedicate one hour each day for these topics. Here are some recommended resources:

- "Introduction to Algorithms" book by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein
- LeetCode (https://leetcode.com/) - A platform for practicing coding questions and algorithms
- HackerRank (https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/10-days-of-javascript) - Offers challenges and tutorials on various programming topics, including data structures and algorithms.

Remember, the key to mastery is consistent practice and implementation. Set realistic goals and gradually increase the complexity of the problems you tackle. Good luck with your studies!
